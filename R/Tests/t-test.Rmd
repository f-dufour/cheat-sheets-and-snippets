> Perform t-test with R on the gapminder dataset.

# Preparation of the data set

```{r}
install.packages("gapminder")
data(gapminder) # Make it visible as an object in the Environment tab
```

# About the data set

## Summary

```{r}
summary(gapminder) # quick summary
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap) # Quick result

attach(gapminder) # Don't need to use the data frame notation anymore (lazy trick)
mean(pop) # It works now
```

## Plots

```{r}
hist(lifeExp)
hist(pop) # Right squewed ... Then log transformation:
hist(log(pop))
boxplot(lifeExp~continent) # Distribution of pop, focused on continents
plot(lifeExp~log(gdpPercap))
```

# Difference of life expetency between south Africa and Ireland

Provide new dataset manipulation functions and the pipe (`%>%`) operator.

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
gapminder %>%
  select(country, lifeExp) %>%
  filter(country == "South Africa" | country == "Ireland") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(Average_life = mean(lifeExp))
```

c.a. 20 years of difference between the two life expetencies.

> **Question**: Is this difference significant ?

```{r}
df1 <- gapminder %>%
  select(country, lifeExp) %>%
  filter(country == "South Africa" | country == "Ireland")


t.test(data=df1, lifeExp~country)
```

Our p-value is: 4.466e-09
We reject the null hypothesis, the difference is significant.

# Data visualization

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
gapminder %>%
  filter(gdpPercap < 50000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=log(gdpPercap), y=lifeExp, col=year, size=pop))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```
